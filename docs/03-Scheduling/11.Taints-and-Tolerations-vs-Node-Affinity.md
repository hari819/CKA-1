# Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
  - Take me to [Video Tutorial](https://kodekloud.com/courses/539883/lectures/10277937)

In this section, we will take a look at Taints and Tolerations vs Node Affinity
- Consider a below problem, where we have 5 nodes  and 5 PODS and Requirement is to place POD1 on Node1, POD2 on Node2, POD3 on Node3, POD4/5 on Node4/5 only

- Solving the problem using Taints and Tolerations  
  - Out of 5 nodes, 3 nodes have a taint set on it Node1=Blue, Node2=Red, Node3=Green
  - Out of 5 Pods, on 3 PODS toleration is defined in the pod spec such that POD1 has a toleration of Blue, POD2 has a toleration of Red and POD3 has a toleration of Green
  - Requirement is to place POD1 on Node1, POD2 on Node2, POD3 on Node3, POD4/5 on Node4/5 only
  - it might happen the POD2 will be placed on Node4/5
  
- Taints and Toleration does not gurantee that the pods will only prefer these nodes, in this case, the red nodes may ends up on one of the other nodes that do not have a taint or toleration set.

- Let's try to solve the same problem on Node Affinity
  - Label the Nodes, Node01 with color=Blue, Node02 with color=Red, Node03 with color=Green
  - Set the affinity specification in the POD defination such as POD1 with nodeSelectos as color=Blue, POD2 with nodeSelectos as color=Red, POD3 with nodeSelectos as color=Green
  - This works level for POD1,2 and 3. But Pod4/5 can be placed on any Node01 to Node05. This is not something we desired
 
 
 - Let's try to solve the problem with taint/toleration and affinity
   - Set taints on the Node1,2,3
   - Set toleration on POD1,2,3
   
   - Set label on the Node1,2,3
   - Set affinity nodeSelector in POD1,2,3
   
   - USing this we should be able to place POD1 on Node1 only, POD2 on Node2 only, POD3 on Node3 only and POD4/5 on Node4/5 only

- As such, a combination of taints and tolerations and node affinity rules can be used together to completely dedicate nodes for specific parts.
